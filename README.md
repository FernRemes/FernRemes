## Personal / Course Work Projects

### AI / ML Projects

> #### -> [Sonar Model](https://github.com/FernRemes/Sonar-Prediction)
      - Personal
      - Simulation model to imitate how a sonar identifies an item. 
      - In this project I use a dataset with two items: [ü™®] Rock and [üí£] Mines.
> #### -> [Movie Recommendator](https://github.com/FernRemes/Movie_Recommendation)
      - Personal
      - Using a dataset to analyze the user's input and use match pattern to categorize 
        possible options that are similar to those of the user's input. 
      - A user inputs their favourite [‚≠ê] movie and the program will give 
        suggestions of other [üé•] movies to recommend to watch. 
> #### -> [PyTorch Digit Recognition](https://github.com/FernRemes/Handwritten_Digit_Recognition_PyTorch)
      - Personal
      - Demonstrating the process of training and evaluating a machine learning model. 
      - The model is trained on a dataset and evaluated for its performance on a test set.
      - From a list of handwritten [üî¢] digits, the model shall accurately determine what digit from a chosen index. [#Ô∏è‚É£]
> #### -> [DCGAN Digit Generator](https://github.com/FernRemes/Handwritten_Digit_Generator_DCGAN)
      - Personal
      - Observe how well a program is able to generate a number from a previous iteration or image using DCGAN 
        and predict the number trying to generate. [üî¢]
      - (DCGAN) A Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network is a type of Generative Adversarial Network that uses 
        deep convolutional neural networks in its architecture. 
      - GANs are a class of machine learning frameworks designed for generative modeling, 
        where the goal is to generate new data samples that resemble a given dataset.

### API Involved Projects

> #### [YouTube Clone](https://github.com/FernRemes/YouTube_Clone)
      - Personal
      - Main Purpose: To ignore YouTube's Algorithm and only view videos you personally want to search for.
      - A [üî¥] YouTube clone is a web application designed to mimic the functionality and features of YouTube, 
        the popular video-sharing platform. 
      - Building a YouTube clone involves creating a platform where users can search, view thumbnails, interact with videos, 
        and view YouTube Channels.
> #### [Weather App](https://github.com/FernRemes/Weather) 
      - Personal
      - Create a personal webpage for the weather. [‚õÖ]

### Powershell / Terminal Focus Projects

> #### [Sudoku Solver](https://github.com/FernRemes/Sudoku-Solver)
      - Personal 
      - The user has the ability to personally input a sudoku and the program shall
        either solve the sudoku or output "No Solution". [üî¢]
> #### [QR Code Generator](https://github.com/FernRemes/QR_Code)
      - Personal
      - The user can input a [‚õìÔ∏è‚Äçüí•] URL and customize the color scheme of their custom QR Code.
> #### [Fallen-Empire](https://github.com/FernRemes/Fallen-Empire)
      - Course Work
      - CS 4177, Software Vulnerabilities.
      - Created installation tutorial, video walkthrough, mutliple powerpoints & a class excercise that students can perform.
      - [üëæ] Powershell-Empire was an open-source post-exploitation agent to "assess resilience of systems against cyber threats."
      - Our team utilized the Kali-Linux with Powershell-Empire & A virtual Machine running Windows 7 for the excercise.
> #### [Ticketminer-Project](https://github.com/FernRemes/UTEP-AOOP-Ticketminer-Project)
      - Course Work
      - CS 3331, Adv. Object Orientation.
      - **Disclaimer** Ticketminer uses a pre-set of data with FAKE user accounts, names, events, venues, and prices.
      - [‚úçÔ∏è] Utilize course lessons of file handling, dynamic structuring using UML Diagrams, design patterns, and polymorphism to emulate Ticketmaster.
      - Just like Ticketmaster, [üéüÔ∏è] Ticketminer has an admin and a user/customer. An admin can add, update, and remove events or venues, 
        while customers are limited to only buying or canceling one or more tickets. The customer can vue their order in their own invoice directory.
> #### [Shortest-Path Dijkastra Map](https://github.com/FernRemes/Dijkastra)
      - Course Work
      - CS 2401, Elem. Data Struct./Algorithms
      - Utilize the Dijkastara Method to find the shortest path between El Paso Community College locations and 
        University of Texas at El Paso.
      
### Web Designing
> #### [Rock Paper Scissors](https://github.com/FernRemes/Rock_Paper_Scissors)
      - Personal
      - A single-page web application for "[ü™®]Rock, [üìú] Paper, [‚úÇÔ∏è] Scissors" where a player competes against a CPU.
      - Involves building a simple interactive interface and backend logic to handle game mechanics and outcomes. 
> #### [Hangman Game](https://github.com/FernRemes/Hangman)
      - Personal
      - A [üßç‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è] Hangman game web application which allows players to try to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters. 
      - Each incorrect guess results in a part of a hangman figure being drawn. 
      - The game ends when the player either guesses the word [üòÑ] correctly or runs out of chances. [üíÄ] 
> #### [Pomu Clock](https://github.com/FernRemes/Pomu_Clock)
      - Personal
      - The [üïì] clock has both standard and military time for all users. 
      - This clock may not be enjoyable for all, but it is to me and gives tribute to a creator. [üßö]
